AURA – Autonomous Unified Response Assistant
The All-in-One Digital Safety App for Women & Girls Across Africa

AURA is a next-generation mobile application designed to protect, empower, and educate women and girls facing digital violence. It combines on-device AI, real-time threat detection, privacy-first engineering, and trauma-informed design into one unified app that works even in low-bandwidth environments.

AURA is built to address the urgent rise of online harassment, cyberstalking, AI-driven exploitation, deepfake misuse, grooming, and identity violations affecting millions across the continent.

🌍 Mission

To create a safer, kinder, and more inclusive digital world for African women and girls by providing intelligent protection, actionable support, and accessible tools that respond to real threats in real time.

🚀 Core Features
1. Real-Time Digital Threat Detection

On-device AI model scans incoming messages across apps (SMS, social platforms, chat apps).

Detects abusive language, manipulation, coercion, cyberbullying, stalking patterns, and grooming behavior.

Works offline through lightweight ML models optimized for low-end phones.

Displays discreet, non-triggering safety alerts.

2. Image Misuse & Deepfake Protection

AI engine proactively searches for misused photos or manipulated content online.

Notifies users if their images appear on suspicious websites or forums.

Adds secure watermarks and facial protection filters to prevent unauthorized use.

6. Learning & Awareness Hub

Micro-lessons on digital safety, privacy, consent, and online rights.

Contextual, culturally relevant tips for African environments.

Safety quizzes, scenario coaching, and offline content.

7. Community Safety Engine

An anonymous reporting mechanism for unsafe accounts and harmful content.

A user reputation scoring system that flags bad actors.

Threat heatmaps showing regional trends of digital violence (fully anonymized).

NGO integration to connect users with real-world help.
