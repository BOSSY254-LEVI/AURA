Create a complete, fully integrated application called AURA (Autonomous Unified Response Assistant). AURA must be a single cohesive app—mobile-first (Android & iOS) with an optional web interface—designed to protect, empower, educate, and support African women and girls against all forms of digital violence. The app must NOT be built as an operating system or as separate modules. Instead, all features must exist within ONE unified application with seamless navigation and consistent UI/UX.

I. CORE PURPOSE OF THE APP

AURA must deliver an end-to-end digital safety experience, combining prevention, detection, response, reporting, community protection, emotional support, and analytics—all in one interface.

The app must:

Detect harmful behavior in real-time

Protect privacy through on-device processing

Provide emergency and safety tools

Offer trauma-sensitive support

Empower users with knowledge

Provide insights and data visualizations

Support offline and low-bandwidth environments

Function securely and reliably on African smartphones

II. MAJOR FEATURES (ALL BUILT INTO ONE APP)
1. Real-Time Digital Abuse Detection (Local AI)

Build an on-device AI engine that detects:

Harassment, hate speech, threats

Manipulation, coercion, and grooming patterns

Image-based abuse and deepfake risks

Harmful or threatening voice notes (transcription + tone analysis)

Must function offline using lightweight models.

2. Safety Guardian Interface

A single dashboard where the user sees:

Recent risks detected

Recommended actions

Safety score

Alerts from suspicious contacts or patterns

A daily “Risk Map” summarizing threats from apps or chats

3. Image & Identity Protection

Include:

Misused-image scanning across public web sources

Photo fingerprinting to detect deepfakes or manipulated content

A user-controlled “Face Lock” watermark for new photos to prevent misuse

4. Evidence Collector & Secure Vault

A built-in vault that safely stores:

Screenshots

Chat logs

Audio clips

Location data

Images

Transcriptions

Metadata

Vault requirements:

End-to-end encryption

Local storage by default

Cloud sync optional

Blockchain or hash-chain timestamping

Export to PDF for authorities

5. Emergency Response System

Include:

Hidden panic button

SMS + WhatsApp fallback alerts

Live location broadcasting

Quick-call trusted contacts

“Silent Help Mode” where the phone looks off but sends alerts

6. Safe Twin – AI Companion

Build an empathetic, trauma-informed AI assistant that can:

Coach users on how to handle online threats

Explain digital safety best practices

Offer emotional support phrases

Provide guidance on reporting abuse

Analyze risky conversations and explain what went wrong

Suggest safer communication patterns

Must speak in calm, non-triggering language.

7. Learning Center (Digital Safety Education Hub)

Include:

Interactive lessons

Gamified safety challenges

Video explainers

Mini-courses (phishing, grooming, deepfakes, privacy, social engineering)

Country-specific legal rights & support resources

Multi-language support: EN, SW, FR, AR, HA, AM.

8. Community Protection Features

Inside the same app, include:

Anonymous reporting of dangerous accounts

Community-driven “Safety Reputation Signals” (no personal data stored)

Verified dangerous-pattern alerts

Ability to identify patterns of repeat offenders across platforms (privacy-preserving)

9. Insights & Visual Analytics

Inside the app, users can see:

A personal threat history

Categories of digital violence they encountered

Geographic patterns of risks (heatmaps)

Time-based charts showing improvements or escalations

Alerts about trending threats affecting women in their region

This replaces separate dashboards with built-in visualization.

10. Offline & Low-Bandwidth Capability

The app must:

Run 80%+ of AI on-device

Defer sync operations to when the user reconnects

Compress data

Keep UI responsive even with weak connectivity

Support SMS interactions for core safety features

11. Accessibility & Inclusivity

Include:

Voice-based navigation

Large-text accessibility

Color-blind friendly palettes

Audio descriptions in multiple languages

12. UI/UX Requirements

Design the app with:

A calming, trauma-informed color palette

Minimal triggers or alarming alerts

Clear information hierarchy

Soft, human-centered microcopy

Smooth transitions and animations

Safe-mode themes for emergency use

III. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
Mobile Technologies

Flutter or React Native (cross-platform)

On-device AI using: TensorFlow Lite, CoreML, Distil models

Backend

Optional cloud sync (user-controlled)

Node.js, FastAPI, or Django

PostgreSQL or MongoDB

JWT authentication

Security

Zero-knowledge encryption

AES-256 local vault

PBKDF2 key strengthening

Minimal log retention

GDPR + African Data Governance compliance

IV. ADDITIONAL FEATURE REQUIREMENTS

Dark & light themes

Configurable notification sensitivity

Multi-profile setup (e.g., guardian mode for parents)

"Safe Keyboard" that warns users before typing sensitive info

“Threat Simulation Mode” to teach users safely

Backup/restore system with encrypted cloud

Tamper-detection (alerts if the phone is compromised)

App stealth mode (icon disguises itself if needed)

V. FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

Generate:

Full app architecture

Detailed feature specifications

Database schema

API routes

Model descriptions

UI mockups

User flows

Security model

Deployment plan

MVP breakdown

Scalability strategy

Build the entire AURA application exactly as described: a single, unified, professional, secure, trauma-informed mobile app with all safety, AI, visualization, emergency, educational, and evidence-handling features integrated into one seamless platform.”
